# Smart Desk
<i>RasPi controlled work station.  Details at 11....</i>

This one's still rather amorphous at this point. I saw a project where a guy built a PC into a desk. The motherboard, drives, power supply, cooling, etc. were all mounted on the underside of store bought desk.  Nifty, space-saving idea. But a little rough around the edges.

I want to to take that idea to a whole other level.  I want to custom design and build a desk.  It'll have a RasPi hidden inside, discrete, safe. Maybe a touch screen built in. A custom, LED desk lamp controlled by RasPi and touch screen.  Drawers that open and close by using touch screen.

Still noodling for ideas on this one....
